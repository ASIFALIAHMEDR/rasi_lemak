# rasi_lemak
We’re here to decode **Rasi**, **Nakshatra**, and all that celestial stuff the stars keep talking about... 
but in a way that actually makes sense (no more cryptic old texts, promise). We’ve taken astrology, thrown it into the digital age, and added a good dose of **Python magic** 🐍💫. 

## 🌟 What is this repo, really?

Welcome to your new best friend. This repo will:
- **Calculate your Rasi** (because, honestly, you should already know that by now, right?).
- **Find your Nakshatra** (the stars have opinions about you too).
- **Give you predictions** based on planetary positions and some serious Python wizardry.
We are basically using Python to predict if your life is about to get epic, or if you’re about to make bad decisions that your future self will regret.


Spoiler alert: It’s probably the latter. 🙃


## 🚀 Getting Started (It's Easy, Promise)

1. **Clone the repo**: Because it’s Python, and you probably know how to do that already.
   ```bash git clone https://github.com/ASIFALIAHMEDR/rasi_lemak.git
